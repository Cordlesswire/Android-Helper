  "body": "# Android-Helper\r\nA small, simple library providing developers with some utility methods to use in their code.\r\n\r\n# Compile in your Project\r\nAdd this in your root build.gradle file (not your module build.gradle file):\r\n\r\n```\r\nallprojects {\r\n\trepositories {\r\n\t\t...\r\n\t\tmaven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, add the dependency in your module:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndependencies {\r\n\t   compile 'com.github.Andrew-Quebe:Android-Helper:v0.1'\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n# Features\r\nAndroid-Helper currently has a small amount of functions, but that will change as future releases become available. Below are some things you can do with it already.\r\n\r\n## Toasts\r\nYou can easily show short or long toasts with this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Short Toast\r\nAndroidHelper.shortToast(getBaseContext(), \"Your message\");\r\n\r\n// Long Toast\r\nAndroidHelper.longToast(getBaseContext(), \"Your message\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Convert Drawables to Bitmaps\r\nThis allows you to convert your drawable resources into Bitmap resources.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAndroidHelper.drawableToBitmap(ResourcesCompat.getDrawable(getResources(), drawable, theme));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Dark Versions of Colors\r\nThis lets you convert your app colors to different shades using float values.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// float value: 0.1 = 10%, 0.9 = 90%\r\nAndroidHelper.darker(Color.parseColor(\"#FFFFFF\"), 0.8f);\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Contributions\r\nIf you'd like to contribute to this library, feel free to make a pull request with your changes. \r\n\r\n# Developed By\r\nAndrew Quebe<br>\r\n[andrewquebe@amqtech.com](mailto:andrewquebe@amqtech.com)\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2016 Andrew Quebe\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
